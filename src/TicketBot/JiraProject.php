Hello,

thank you for creating this pull request. However you did not open it on the "master"
branch. Our Git workflow requires all pull requests to go through "master" branch
and the release masters then merge them back into stable branches, if they are
bug fixes.

Please open the pull request again for the "master" branch and close
this one.

Nevertheless I have opened a Jira ticket for this Pull Request to track this
issue:
